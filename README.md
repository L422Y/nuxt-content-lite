Light-use markdown driven content engine inspired by Nuxt Content for doing amazing things with markdown, with less.

## Why?

[Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/) is an amazing module, but it's a bit heavy for some use cases. Nuxt Content
Lite is a lightweight
alternative for those who don't need all the bells and whistles.

The goal of Nuxt Content Lite is to provide a simple, lightweight, and flexible way to use markdown content in your Nuxt
app or website, while keeping things light and fast.

## Who is this for?

Smaller sites, blogs, and apps that don't need all the bells and whistles of Nuxt Content.

The primary use case for Nuxt Content Lite is for small sites that need a little more than just static content, but
don't need a full-blown CMS like Wordpress.

If you're building a large site, a blog with a ton of posts, or app, you should probably
use [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/).

## What's the difference?

> We use tuples instead of objects for storing content!

...and we don't have a lot of the features that Nuxt Content has.

Currently, Nuxt Content Lite renders all content into a single file on build. This means that while you can use Nuxt
Content Lite to build a blog, you probably shouldn't use it to build a blog with a ton of posts.

We're working on a way to split content into multiple files, but for now, Nuxt Content Lite is best for smaller sites.

## Usage

The primary way to use Nuxt Content Lite is with the `ContentLiteDoc` component and the `useContentLite` composable.

### ContentLiteDoc

The `ContentLiteDoc` component is a simple component that renders markdown content. It's primary use is for rendering
markdown content in a page or layout.

It accepts an optional `item` prop, which is the content item you want to render the content for.

If no `item` prop is provided, it will attempt to fetch the content for the current route, using the `singleRouteContent`
method of the `useContentLite` composable.

```vue

<template>
  <ContentLiteDoc/>
  <!-- or -->
  <ContentLiteDoc :item="item"/>
  <!-- or -->
  <div v-for="post in posts" :key="post.slug">
    {{post.title}}
  </div>
</template>

<script lang="ts" setup>

  // instantiate the composable
  import { IContentLiteItem } from "./index"

  const cl = await useContentLite({
    // generates word list w/ counts as Map<string, number> 
    // as `words` property on the content item
    filterable: true,
    // flattens the frontmatter into the content item
    flattenData: true,
  })

  // get a single content item for the current route
  const item = await cl.singleRouteContent()
  // or at a specific path
  const post = await cl.findOne("blog/awesome-post")
  const author = await cl.findOne(`authors/${post.author}`)


  // get all content for the current route
  const allItems = await cl.routeContent()
  // or all content for a specific path
  const posts = await cl.find("blog")


  // get all content
  const allContent = cl.contentData

</script>
```
